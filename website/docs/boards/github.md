## Registering

In order to use GitHub as a [board](/), you should first authenticate. If you are familiar with GitHub and is already part of your workflow, is likely that you'll have a `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable already configured. You can check if GitHub is already configured by running:

```r
nchar(Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")) > 0
```

If the above statement is `TRUE`, this means GitHub is already configured, which means you can register an existing GitHub board as follows. However, when using a new repo, first manually create an empty repo from [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).

```r
library(pins)
board_register_github(repo = "owner/repo")
```

Usually, you will want to set `owner` to be your GitHub username or an organization name you belong to, learn more [About Repositories](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-repositories) in the GitHub docs.

Notice that `board_register_github()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```r
board_register("github", repo = "owner/repo")
```

Alternatively, you can create a GitHub token at [github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the required permissions to access your repo. For public repos, you only need the `public_repo` scope:

Once the token is created, you can register your GitHub board through:

```r
board_register_github(repo = "owner/repo", token = "<new-token>")
```

This completes the board registration process, you can now focus on using and sharing pins in GitHub.

## Pinning

Let's start by creating to pins for `iris` and `mtcars` under the GitHub board,

```r
pin(iris, description = "The iris data set", board = "github")
pin(mtcars, description = "The motor trend cars data set", board = "github")
```

Notice then the structure in the GitHub repo. Similar to the folder structure in the local board, a folder is created for each pin and a `data.txt` index added to the repo.

![](/images/docs/boards-github-repo.png)

You can also retrieve pins back from this repo using the now familiar `pin_get()` function,

```r
pin_get("iris", board = "github")
```
```

# â€¦ with 140 more rows
```

## Discovering

You can then search pins in your repo using `pin_find()`, which by default search all boards but you can also explicitly request to use this particular GitHub board:

```r
pin_find("motor", board = "github")
```
```
# A tibble: 1 x 4
  name   description                   type  board
  <chr>  <chr>                         <chr> <chr>
1 mtcars The motor trend cars data set table github
```

GitHub boards contain extended fields that go beyond the fields `pins` requires, to retrieve all the additional fields use `extended = TRUE`:

```r
pin_find("data", board = "github", extended = TRUE)
```
```
# A tibble: 2 x 7
  name   description                   type  path    rows  cols board
  <chr>  <chr>                         <chr> <chr>  <int> <int> <chr>
1 iris   The iris data set             table iris     150     5 github
2 mtcars The motor trend cars data set table mtcars    32    11 github
```

Or `pin_info()` to retrieve all the information associated with a particular pin,

```r
pin_info("mtcars", board = "github")
```
```
# Source: github<mtcars> [table]
# Description: The motor trend cars data set
# Extended:
#   - path: data.csv, data.rds
#   - rows: 32
#   - cols: 11
#   - columns:
#     - mpg: numeric
#     - cyl: numeric
#     - disp: numeric
#     - hp: numeric
#     - drat: numeric
#     - wt: numeric
#     - qsec: numeric
#     - vs: numeric
#     - am: numeric
#     - gear: numeric
#     - carb: numeric
```

Notice that the given 'motor' search keyword is searched in the name and description fields for the pins available in this repo.

## Sharing

When working in teams, you might want to share your pins with others. For GitHub boards, this is accomplished by adding collaborators through the GitHub website.

Once your collaborators gain access to the repo, they can follow the same steps to register the same GitHub board to allow them to upload and download pins with ease.

### Large Files

A GitHub repo only supports files under 25MB in size (100MB in theory but there is additional overhead when using the GitHub API). To store large files, GitHub [recommends](https://help.github.com/en/articles/distributing-large-binaries) storing them using GitHub Releases which support up to 2GB files.

Therefore, to support large files, `pins` makes use of GitHub release files. When you upload a file over , `pins` will create a new GitHub release file for that particular pin. Everything else works as expected, you can still retrieve the large resource with `pin_get()` and find it with `pin_find()`. The only noticeable change is new releases being created in your repo:

You can configure the 25MB check to use release files with the `pins.github.release` option.
