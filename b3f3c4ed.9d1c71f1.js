It is common to give explicit instructions to download datasets before actually importing the dataset. However, manual steps make it hard to reproduce your code -- we can no longer just copy-paste and run code. One easy solution is to explicitly download the file from code; however, this would cause the file to be re-downloaded each time the code runs, so you can then try to check if the file already exists, and keep adding complexity to try to reliably download and cache files. Quoting Phil Karlton, "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things". So instead of worrying when to invalidate and cache online resources, you can use ',Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pin()")," to cache any resource with ease."),Object(s.b)("p",null,Object(s.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Share"),": There are cases where you might want to not only communicate with others your results, but also allow others to reuse your results. For instance, once you finish analyzing house remodel projects, you might also want to share your final dataset for others to reuse.

For instance, suppose that you are trying to figure out what kind of house remodel could increase your home property value the most, where do you get such data from? You can search online but is often hard to filter results to contain only datasets, it also requires you to have some knowledge of which data sources are trustworthy and so on. This is obviously a hard problem and we can't expect a single tool to magically fix this for us; instead, the ",Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pins.js")," package gives you a few tools to search well known data repositories through the ",Object(s.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pin_find()")," function.
